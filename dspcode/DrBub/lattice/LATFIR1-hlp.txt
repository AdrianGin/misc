  Description: Lattice FIR Filter Assembler Macro

  This macro implements a lattice fir filter using reflection coefficients.

   BACKGROUND

   The basic section of a FIR lattice filter is shown in Figure 1.

  The reference [j] indicates the jth stage  and  the  reference
  (n)  indicates  the  sample  time.  The equations for a filter
  section are:

                  f[j](n)= f[j-1](n) + k[j]*b[j-1](n-1)
                  b[j](n)= b[j-1](n-1) + k[j]*f[j-1](n)

  The signals f(n) and b(n)  are  commonly  referred  to  as  the
  forward  and  backward  prediction residuals respectively.

   IMPLEMENTATION

  A third order lattice FIR filter is shown in Figure 2.

                                 Figure 2
   For the filter shown, the pointers R0 and R4  are  initialized
  to point to the buffers as shown:

         R0                 R4
        |                  |
        v                  v
    x:  S1 S2 S3 Sx     y: k1 k2 k3 kx
         M0=3 (mod 4)       M4=3 (mod 4)

  The register R0 is initialized to point to the  start  of  the
  state  variable  buffer  and R4 is initialized to point to the
  first k coefficient of the filter.  The modulo  registers  are
  set  to  the  number  of  coefficients  in the filter (in this
  example there are three).  Note that the modulo  storage  area
  is equal to the number of filter coefficients+1.

  The input sample is put in the B register and then the  filter
  macro  is called.  The result of the filtering operation is in
  B.  The state 'sx' is an unused state which  aids  calculation
  efficiency.   (Actually,  the  value  sx  after  a  sample  is
  filtered is the output of the lower leg of  the  filter.)  The
  reflection coefficient 'kx' is an unused dummy value.

  To use the filter, it is assumed the registers R0, R4, M0  and
  M4 have been properly initialized.  The input sample is put in
  register B and the filter is called as:

              latfir order               ;call fir lattice filter

  where 'latfir' is the macro name and 'order' is the number  of
  k coefficients.

  FILTER OPERATION

  The filter operation can be described (refer to Figure  2  and
  the macro 'latfir1' in the DSPLIB):

   1.  The input sample is in register B.  This input sample will
      be  the  first  state  S1 at the next sample time and will
      initialize the T value.

   2.  The first state S1 is  loaded  into  x0.The first k 
	coefficient  k1 is  loaded  into  y0  and the pointer R4 is 
	incremented to point to the next coefficient.

   3.  The MOVE instruction saves the input  sample  to  A.

   4.  The loop will make as many passes of the filter kernel  as
      there are coefficients in the filter.

   5.  The state (X0) is now multiplied by the k coefficient (Y0)
      and added to the old value of T to get the new value of T.
	The current value of T (in register B) is moved into a product
      register so it can be multiplied by the k coefficient.
   
   6.  The old state S1 is loaded into accumulator A so that  the
      the  bottom  b[j](n)  can be computed (see Figure 1). 
	Simultaneously, the new state variable (A)  is  saved. The 
	pointers R0 is incremented to point to  the  next  state.

   7.  The value b[j](n) is now computed by the second MAC.  The T
      value  in  Y1 is multiplied by the k coefficient in Y0 and
      added to the value of the previous state (A).  This  value
      will  be  the  value  of S2 for the next sample time. The 
      next state is loaded  into  x0. The next k coefficient is  
	loaded  into  y0  and the pointer R4 is incremented to point 
	to the next coefficient.

   8.  Three passes of this  loop  are  made.   The  first  state
      needed  for  the  second  sample is currently saved at the
      first location of the state buffer with the  other  states
      calculated  by  the  loop  saved in consecutive locations.
      The last state that the loop calculates (Sx) is not needed
      for the next sample time.

   9.  Save Sx and points the state buffer to the first state (S1).
	Note that the initial MOVE increments the pointer to the k's 
	by one and the loop increments  the pointer  three times.  
	In order to have the pointer to the k's pointing to the first 
	coefficient (k1), the modulo  on the k pointer is four.

    The benchmarks for this  filter  are:   8  instructions,  3N+9
    clock cycles, 2 stack locations.

    An example of how to use this macro is in the file LATFIR1T.ASM.
