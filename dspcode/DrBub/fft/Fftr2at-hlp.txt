 The FFTR2A_T.ASM program performs a complete 32-point Fast Fourier Transform
 (FFT) on complex data.  The program calls the FFTR2A and SINCOS macros. This
 program can also be used for testing FFTR2AA, FFTR2B, FFTR2BF, FFTR2C, FFTR2CC,
 FFTR2D, and FFTR2E. By changing the variable "points", it can perform any size
 FFT from 2-32768 points. Some FFT macros, such as FFTR2B or FFTR2C, can execute
 faster at the expense of more program memory.

 The FFTR2CN_T.ASM program performs a complete 32 point Fast Fourier Transform
 (FFT) on complex data.  The program can be used to test the FFTR2CN and FFTR2EN.
 By changing the variable "points", it can perform any size FFT from 2-32768
 points using approximately 47 words of program memory.  Note that the 32 point
 complex FFT is performed using a sinewave table of 256 points.

 The FFTR2D_T.ASM program performs a complete 32 point Fast Fourier Transform
 (FFT) on complex data.  The program calls the FFTR2D and SINEWAVE macros. By
 changing the variable "points", it can perform any size FFT from 2-32768 points
 using approximately 47 words of program memory.  Note that the 32 point complex
 FFT is performed using a sinewave table of 256 points.
