To use the viterbi encoder and decoder you must follow the following instructions:

First, create a random data file of integer numbers from 0-15.
Then load the encoder after entering the simulator:

load encode

Then, use this file as input to the encoder (encode.asm)  with the input command:

input y:$ee filename -rd 

where the filename must be filename.io 

The following output command will tell the encode program the filename to  
output the data:

output y:$ef outfilename -rd

where this filename is different from the input file name. 
The output file will then be used to run the decode routine along with these commands: 

load decode 
load bound.d
input y:$efe outfilename -rd
output y:$eff outputfilename -rd
break return
go

This should give satisfactory results in the outputfilename.io file. 
This program works for the V.32 Trellis.
