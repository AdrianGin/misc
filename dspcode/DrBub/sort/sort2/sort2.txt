  Description: Sorting an Array by Heapsort Method

 SORT2 is a programming example of the Heapsort method on the DSP56300.
 The macro will sort an array of size "N_ITEMS" in X memory space
 starting at location "ARRAY". 

 SORT2 uses the Heapsort method to sort an ARRAY of signed numbers. 
 The sort is performed "in-place" and requires no additional memory
 locations. The algorithm was invented by J. Williams [1] and is based
 on a binary tree sort method.  It requires more complicated coding
 but requires fewer elementary operations than more straightforward
 methods [2]. 

 For SORT2 the execution time is proportional to NlogN, where N is
 the array size (N_ITEMS).  Unlike SORT1, the execution time for
 SORT2 is not constant for any given array size.  If the array is
 already ordered, inversely ordered or randomly ordered, the execution
 time will vary. The benchmarks are for randomly ordered arrays.

 SORT2 is more efficient for larger arrays.  The SORT1 macro is
 efficient for sorting smaller arrays of numbers.
