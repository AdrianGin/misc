<h1>A new version - what did change?<em></em></h1>
<p>OS 2.7 represents one of the biggest changes and improvements ever made to the Virus TI series software. It also represents nine month of work and the feedback of an extensive public beta test program.</p>
<p>Among hundreds of refinements and bug fixes, the following new features have been added:</p>
<p>- A new effect Glitch/FSU effect called Atomizer<br />
  - An optional third USB stereo output sending audio from the TI hardware into Virus Control<br />
  - 
  Support for multiple Viruses on one computer<br />
  - 
  Virus Control Center application</p>
<p>Please take the time to familiarise yourself with the new additions. Please read through the documentation supplied, especially the sequencer tutorials which were improved for your convenience. Yes, we know that nobody likes reading support documents but without knowing about the new features you might miss something which might inspire you to write greater music.</p>
<p>A dedicated addendum explains all additions in-depth and can be found using the <img src="BTN_Help.png" alt="Question Mark Menu" width="21" height="21" align="absmiddle" /> button at the right lower corner of this window.</p>
