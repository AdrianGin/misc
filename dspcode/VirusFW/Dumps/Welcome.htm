<h1 class="VirusControlStyles">Welcome to the Virus TI world</h1>
<p>This document is intended to help you with your first steps using the Virus TI. Please read it carefully, it might save you a significant amount of time finding the right information.</p>
<p>The first and probably most important step is to setup your sequencer in the right way. Click on the <img src="BTN_Help.png" alt="Question Mark Button" width="21" height="21" align="absmiddle" /> at the right lower corner of this window and open the tutorial document for your sequencer. Once, everything is setup, open the tutorial song which can be found in the same menu. In case you a discover problem, please don't hesitate to contact us - we like to help you out. A link to Access Support can be found in the very same menu again.</p>
<p>The Virus Control plug-in will now examine the connection to the Virus TI hardware and synchronise the memory content. This will take a couple of minutes but the good news is that the synchronisation only needs to be performed one single time.</p>
<p>Have fun with your Virus !</p>
